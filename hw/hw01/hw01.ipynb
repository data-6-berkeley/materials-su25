    "[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) isn't a programming language \u2013 it's a \"markup language\", which means that it is designed to format text to look nice. But like a programming language, Markdown has a set of rules (syntax) that govern how it works. Think of it like a fancy Google Docs.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Double asterisks (`**`) are how we make words bold. `My name is **Jordan**` renders to \"My name is **Jordan**\".\n",
    "- Underscores (`_`) are how we make words italicized. `How are _you_?` renders to How are _you_?, and `what is **_up_**` renders to what is **_up_**.\n",
    "- Hashtags (`#`, `##`, `###`) are how we create titles/headings. The more hashtags you include, the smaller the title is. The title for this question was generated using `## Question 5 \u2013 Markdown`.\n",
    "- Bulleted lists are created using the (`-`) character.\n",
    "- Numbered lists are created the same way they're created in a standard word processor, like Google Docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is important to learn because Jupyter Notebooks are often full of Markdown cells (just like this assignment). In future assignments, we will ask you to write answers to written questions using Markdown, and while the majority of your answers will be in plaintext (i.e. with none of the special characters above), learning Markdown is valuable nonetheless.\n",

These weights are likely computed through demographic data like age, gender, location, race/ethnicity, income, etc. The `Data Weight` variable from the original `brfss` table by individual was used to compute the `% Population` variable in this `sleep` table, aggregated by sleep time.\n",
